# Sporulation Utilities

DRAM-v and DRAM are powerful tools that generate massive amounts of data and can distil that information to summarises of organismal metabolism.
With much power comes much complexity, great time and effort has gone into the metabolic pathways that are included with DRAM/DRAM-v, but these are only the surface of DRAMs potential.

In this Repository we are collecting a set of tools that alow DRAM-v and to an extent DRAM to explore sporutlation and more specicaly the annotate and discover the auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) that are key to it.
The first step of this process is simply to run DRAM-v on the V-MAGs of interest, and then to use DRAM-v's distilation tool to apply a custom distillation module.
However, after that point science begins and things get tricky, most of the tools in this repo are to help with those next steps.

## Getting started

The tools in this repository are described below with examples.
In order to use the example code you will need to download the full github repo using the command below.
However, if you want to use one tool or file, and don't need the examples, just use the wget links in the tool sections.
